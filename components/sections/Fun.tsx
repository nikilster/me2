    description: `The story of how a Sunday afternoon project became the #1 Social App on the App Store! ðŸŽ‰

Joe Lau and I moved to San Francisco and we missed our friends because we were working all of the time. We thought it would be awesome if we could press a button and hang out with our friends.  We had a couple hours free on a Sunday so we decided to build an app to do that.  We shared a link to the beta on facebook and 8 hours later at a party, a girl who we had never met had heard of it. 24 hours later a ton of our friends were using it and 48 hours later people around the world were on DTL and getting lunch with their friends.

In January 2016, Down To Lunch spontaneously exploded across the country - the map to the left shows just 20% of the new users that joined during that time.  It was the craziest month of our lives so far, working insane hours and having crazy awesome incredible things happen every single day.

The next several months were the craziest of our entire lives.  As DTL continued to grow and be used by college students around the world, we marathon coding sessions to keep the servers up, went a week at a time without seeing the outside world, and broke Apple's iMessage infrastructure because we started getting 5000 text messages a day. (After emailing the CEO of Apple and talking to his executive help staff, we discovered we were some of the top iMessage users in the world! ðŸ˜‚) More stories to come!`,

That summer, working with Salik Syed, Zavain Dar, and Stellios Leventis, we added geolocation features (both on mobile and the browser) to create a way for students around the country to see what was going on around their campus and where their friends were in real time.

I was shocked to learn that how much money a candidate spent was the determining factor in who voted for them rather than what the candidates believed in and I realized that a big contributing factor to this was that no one actually knew what the candidates believed in and there was no simple way to find this out.

I felt like there HAD to be some good way of simply finding out and learning what the candidates believed in and that if it didn't exist, I needed to create one. So the idea was hatched over winter break and Vote For Your Beliefs was born. I worked with Shelly Ni to make this.`,

I thought Mint.com was too complicated (even though I had heard it was the simplest and cleanest UI) so I built what I wanted.

This was created around the observation that the successful people I know focus on what they have and what they want. Applying this principle to wealth, the dashboard shows you how much you own and how it is growing over time instead of just displaying a list of your past purchases like most sites do.

It turned out to be much harder than I initially thought to build this because Mint does not have an API and it was very difficult to access the data that I wanted. Finally after building some tricky ways to finagle the data, I came up with this dashboard.

To use it:
1. Open Chrome
2. Install the Wealth Dashboard
3. Go to Mint.com and log in
4. Enjoy :)`,

Real world tests of the technology infused into physical apparel have exceeded laboratory performance and produced astounding results!

Just 1 week of wearing the new technology interwoven into fabric has transformed our users' lives, see for yourself from the test subjects:

Russ Nickel, Film Student
"I wore the shirt for 3 workouts this week and increased my bench press by 150 lbs! Walking down the hallway at college, I was swarmed by girls trying to rip off my clothes and could barely escape. It was like I was in an AXE commercial. (I could have directed a much better commercial though)"

Angad Singh, Stanford Junior
"I wore the shirt when I was coding one night and built a new asynchronous threaded event driven javascript client-server framework for fetching generic AJAX requests with high throughput on a NoSQL sharded schema. It's basically the next node.js and I didn't even use Twitter Bootstrap or LaunchRock for the promo page! In addition I wrote it in 30 minutes at a frat party while taking a break from my English paper."

David Philipson, Palantir Starcraft Team
"I wore the shirt during my Starcraft match with a Heart of the Swarm Grandmaster and was able to overcome a 4 Gate with only 2 zerglings while I simultaneously expanded to 6 bases and killed with him ONLY drones all while writing a game in Scala on my other monitor! This new buffering technology literally doubled my APMs and micro skills; oh and just FYI, that guy was Korean."

All early tests seem to indicate that this technology is revolutionary and will have major cross industry impact -we are in the middle of raising an angel round and are currently oversubscribed but if you can send us a check in the next couple days we might consider it.`,
